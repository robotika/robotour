Robotour - robotika.cz outdoor delivery challenge

version 3 (2016-05-04)

The Goal of the contest

The objective of the Robotour contest is to encourage development of robots
capable of transporting you to work in the morning or to deliver the building
material you have just purchased in an online shop. The path to this goal is
neither easy nor short, but we believe that the outcome is worth it.

Rules

Task

The task for the robots is to deliver payload in given 1 hour time limit to
destination as far as 1km. Robots must be fully autonomous, not leave the road
and choose correct path on junctions. The place of start and destination will
be the same for all robots.

Map

The robots can only use Open Street Map. The key concept of this map is its
verifiability.  Anything that is verifiable and is described in map features
can be used by the teams to update the map of the contest area. Note, that Open
Street Map is primarily used for people, and certain rules have to be
respected.

Robots

Team can deploy only one robot. Every robot must have EMERGENCY STOP button,
which stops its motion. The button must be easily accessible, red and must be
fixed part of the robot (Big Red Switch), so it could be used in case of
danger. The minimum size of the switch is defined by an inscribed circle with
diameter of 2cm. The team must show that it is easy to manipulate with the
robot - two people must be able to carry it several tens of meters. There is
also minimal size - robot has to carry full 5l beer barrel 
(there is an exception related to automatic loading and unloading, see below).

Leaving the road

The robots are expected to stay “on the road” which means to stay on the paved
passage ways. If any robot leaves the road, the trial ends. The team has to
take care of their robot and remove it immediately.  

Obstacles 

There could be
obstacles on the road. Besides natural obstacles like benches there could be
also artificial obstacles. A typical (artificial) obstacle is for example a
figurant, a banana paper box or other robot. Robots may not touch an obstacle.
Contact with an obstacle means end of the trial. The robot may stop in front of
the obstacle and visually or acoustically give notice.  Note, that the robot
has to detect, that the obstacle is no longer present.

Robots Interaction

The cases where a faster robot catches up a slower one won't be explicitly
handled. The faster robot can handle the slower robot as an obstacle, i.e.
avoid it or wait until the obstacle disappears. In general the road rules
will be respected: right of way, avoidance to the right, passing on the left.

Start

All robots will start simultaneously from the same park road. Start area for
each team will have approx. 1.5x1.5 meters. Start areas will follow one after
another on one side of the road. In the start area each team can place its
robot as they see fit. The order of robots on start is given by the results the
in previous round(s) (a better robot will be further away from the destination). The
order in the first round will be given by the order of successful homologation.
Robots start automatically via their internal timers. One minute before the
start, no interaction with the robot is allowed.  Robot, which starts before
official start time, will be disqualified for given round and will get zero
points.

Blocking traffic

Due to the crowds of robots in potential narrow roads it is necessary to deal
with traffic blockage. Every team can in any time sue a robot of another team
that is blocking road. From that moment sued robot has one minute to leave an
area defined by +/- one meter from its current position. If the robot fails to
leave this area it will be stopped and removed from the road. Otherwise the
contest continues and suing team gets warning for false judge. If this is for
the 3rd time the robot of suing team is stopped and removed from the road.

Reaching goal

The robot has to indicate when the goal is reached, for example via sound
signal.  The judge marks that position and robot autonomously navigate back to
the start without operator interaction.  Score The team whose robot manage best
to proceed along the route wins. The aerial distance of the last robot position
(leaving the road, a collision or a timeout) to destination (or start if
destination was reached) is critical. For every meter towards the destination
team gets one point = distance(start,goal)-distance(final position,goal). If
the robot reached the goal the measured distance is calculated as 2*distance
(start,goal) - distance(marked position,goal) - distance(final position,start).
In every round a robot can get at most twice the aerial distance of the start
and the destination.

Organization

The contest will consist of 4+1 trials for each team. The start and destination
will be different for every trial. The selected destination will be announced
to all teams 10 minutes before the start. The speed of the robots is not
important (actually the speed limit is 2.5m/s). All points gained during all
trials will be summed together. The trial starts at a specified time and ends
after 1 hour. The robot must leave the start area within 10 minutes of the
start. Each team has to arrange for one person familiar with the rules that
will be part of the referee team during the competition.

Homologation

A team can participate in the contest if it is able to score at least one
point.  Necessary condition is the ability to travel 10 meters long route
fragment without collision with an obstacle. The start procedure will be tested
(automatic start) as well as the functionality of the EMERGENCY STOP. Usage of
liquids, corrosive, pyrotechnic material and live beings is strictly
prohibited. Every robot has to be accompanied by a team member, older 18 years,
who is fully responsible for the robot behavior.

Technical documentation

Every team has to provide basic technical documentation about their robot (for
presentations, general public and journalists). Three winning teams will be
asked for more detail description for website presentation and easier entry of
novices in the next year.

Automatic loading and unloading (new in 2016)

Robot which is capable of automatic barrel loading and pass start line within
10 minutes starting period gains extra 50 points. There is another 50 points
bonus for automatic unloading at destination. In this case the return voyage
is without payload.

Now there is also alternative smaller payload allowed - 500ml cans (up to 10
pieces), if the robot is capable loading them automatically. The whole size of
robot has to be bigger than 5 liter barrel to simplify object detection to
other robots. Bonus for every automatically loaded, as well as automatically
unloaded, can is 5 points.

The barrel-cans must be placed 1 minute before start time in virtual starting
box of the robot. There has to be space between robot and the can/barrel.
Note, that no extra helpers like tables, loaders etc. are not allowed.
The starting box has to be empty in 10 minutes after start.
