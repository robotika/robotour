Robotour - robotika.cz outdoor delivery challenge

version 7 (2018-02-01)

The Goal of the contest

The objective of the Robotour contest is to encourage development of robots
capable of transporting you to work in the morning or to deliver the building
material you have just purchased in an online shop. The path to this goal is
neither easy nor short, but we believe that the outcome is worth it.

Rules

Task

The task for the robots is to pickup payload in loading area, deliver it to
the destination for unloading and return back to service area. This has to be
realized within 1 hour time limit and the destination can be
as far as 1km. Robots must be fully autonomous, not leave the road
and choose correct path on junctions. The coordinates of loading and unloading zones will
be the same for all robots.

Map

The robots can only use Open Street Map. The key concept of this map is its
verifiability.  Anything that is verifiable and can be described in map features
can be used by the teams to update the map of the contest area. Note, that Open
Street Map is primarily used for people, and certain rules have to be
respected.

Robots

Team can deploy only one robot. Every robot must have EMERGENCY STOP button,
which stops its motion. The button must be easily accessible, red and must be
fixed part of the robot (Big Red Switch), so it could be used in case of
danger. The minimum size of the switch is defined by an inscribed circle with
diameter of 2cm.
The team must show that it is easy to manipulate with the
robot - two people must be able to carry it several tens of meters.
Robot has to be able to carry full 5l beer barrel, which
should be easy to load and unload.
Size of robot even without the barrel should at least the same as the barrel
to allow easy detection by other robots.
Usage of liquids, corrosive, pyrotechnic material and live beings is strictly
prohibited.
Every robot has to be accompanied by a team member, older than 18 years,
who is fully responsible for the robot behavior.

Leaving the road

The robots are expected to stay “on the road” which means to stay on the paved
passage ways. If any robot leaves the road, team receives penalization and the trial ends.
The team has to take care of their robot and remove it immediately.

Obstacles

There can be obstacles on the road. Besides natural obstacles like benches
there can be also artificial obstacles. A typical (artificial) obstacle is for example a
figurant, a banana paper box or other robot. Robots may not touch an obstacle.
Contact with an obstacle means penalization and end of the trial.

Robots Interaction

The cases where a faster robot catches up a slower one won't be explicitly
handled. The faster robot can handle the slower robot as an obstacle, i.e.
avoid it or wait until the obstacle disappears. In general the road rules
will be respected: right of way, avoidance to the right, passing on the left.
Due to the crowds of robots in potential narrow roads it is necessary to deal
with traffic blockage. Every team can in any time sue a robot of another team
that is blocking road. From that moment sued robot has one minute to leave an
area defined by +/- one meter from its current position. If the robot fails to
leave this area it will be stopped and removed from the road. Otherwise the
contest continues and suing team gets warning for false judge. With 3rd and all
other warnings the robot of suing team is stopped and removed from the road.


Autonomous, semiautonomous and service areas

The competition area is divided into "Autonomous Area" and "Service Area".
Outside of service area the robots must move in autonomous mode only.
In the case of a collision, leaving the road or due to some other issues the
team have to remove the robot from the Autonomous Area.
All the maintenance and programming will take place in service area only.
There is also a "Semiautonomous Area" between autonomous and
service area. In the semiautonomous area the robot has to navigate autonomously
but in a case of problem the team can take the robot back to service area without
penalization and continue with the trial.

Start

All robots will start simultaneously within the service
area. At given time the coordinates of loading area will be announced.
The coordinates will be defined via QR code. Contestants can pass the
entry to their robot in the service area. Unloading zone coordinates
will be passed to robot by organizers using QR code in loading zone.

Reaching goal

Loading and unloading area is defined as 10m diameter around given coordinate.
The robot has to indicate when the goal is reached (in both loading and
unloading area), for example via sound signal. Organizer will load/unload the barrel.
In loading zone, organizer will enter the unloading zone coordinates using QR code.
Finish of loading/unloading operation will be signalized to robot by team-defined, simple way, for example pressing of button.

Score

The team whose robot manage best to proceed along the route wins. Only reaching
the goals positions is awarded 10 points for reaching the load area and 10 points
for reaching the unload area. Finally 10 points can be gained for return to
service area after task completion. In total the team can get maximum of 30 points
per run.

There is also a penalty 5 points if robot leaves the road, collides with an obstacle,
or must be stopped by emergency STOP button. The robot can terminate its attempt
any time, by stopping and indicating (for example flashing lights).
In this case no penalty is enforced, but given round is over for this particular
robot. The score for one round shall not be negative.

Organization

The contest will consist of 1+4 trials. First test trial and 4 contest trials.
The coordinates of loading and unloading zone will be different for every trial.
Scores from all 4 contest trials are summed into final score.
Each trial is started at given time by announcment of loading zone coordinates
and ends 60 minutes later.
The speed of the robots is not important, robot should not move faster than 2.5m/s.
Each team has to arrange for one person familiar with the rules that will be part of
the referee team during the competition.

Homologation

A team can participate in the contest if it is able to score some points.
Necessary condition is the ability to travel 10 meters long route
fragment without collision with an obstacle.
The functionality of the EMERGENCY STOP will be tested.
Complete loading procedure will be tested - signalization, manual load, QR-code entry and continue of trial.

Technical documentation

Every team has to provide basic technical documentation about their robot (for
presentations, general public and journalists). Three winning teams will be
asked for more detail description for website presentation and easier entry of
novices in the next year.
